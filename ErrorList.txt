Error list

IglooScore1:
1. Inside the first if statement in overallScore(), where score1 and score2 are being compared, the '<' sign is backwards, it should be '>'.
2. The program isn't checking to see if the scores are inside the range given, 0 through 50.

IglooScore2:
1. Inside the second else if statement in overallScore(), we're checking to see if score2 is the lowest score, s2 = score2 is no needed therefore it should be s2 = score3.
2. The else statement in overallScore() is never invoked, will never reach it therefore it can be removed completly.
3. The conditons inside the third else if statement in overallScore(), are not needed therefore the else if should be changed into an else statement.
